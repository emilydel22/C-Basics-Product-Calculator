## Overview
This project implements a C-based embedded program for sensor data acquisition and processing. The code reads input signals from hardware sensors, performs basic computations, and outputs results suitable for validation and analysis in a biomedical engineering context.

The project emphasizes low-level programming, hardware interaction, and structured data handling commonly used in embedded and medical device systems.
