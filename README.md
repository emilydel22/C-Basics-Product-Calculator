This repository contains a basic C program that calculates the product of two integers entered by the user. The program demonstrates fundamental C concepts including user input, function calls, global variables, and formatted output with date and time.

---

## Project Overview

The program prompts the user to enter two integers between 1 and 100, computes their product using a separate function, and displays the result. It also prints the programmer’s name and the current date/time using the C standard time library.

This assignment was completed as part of **EEL 2880** and serves as an introduction to structured programming in C.
